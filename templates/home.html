				<p> Iâ€™m Sam, and I create data tools for school leaders, teachers, and students. My goal is the make data-driven instruction simple and transparent, so that educators can easily support their classrooms, and schools, and focus on providing the highest quality advising for their students.
      Currently, I work for OneGoal as a Senior Director of Analytics managing a team of analysts to support the buildout of our district coaching program. Previously, I have worked in data roles supporting schools in Nasvhille, TN and Jackson MI.
			I build and innovate using data systems and tools such as PowerBI, PostgreSQL, and Python. I am inspired by the educators that I work with, passionate about how data can address education inequity, and am always enthusiastic to discuss my work. </p>
