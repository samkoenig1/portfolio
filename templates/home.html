				<p> Iâ€™m Sam, and I create data tools for school leaders, teachers, and students. My goal is the make data-driven instruction simple and transparent, so that educators can easily address gaps in their schools and classrooms, and focus on providing the highest quality advising for their students. </p>
        <p> Currently, I work for OneGoal as a Senior Director of Analytics piloting a post-secondary access and persistence course, as well as supporting the buildout of our new district coaching program. I innovate using data systems and tools such as PowerBI, PostgreSQL, and Python. </p>
        <p> I am inspired by the educators that I work with, passionate about how data can address education inequity, and am always enthusiastic to discuss our work, so feel free to reach out!	</p>
